This is a set of tools aimed at producing high quality color schemes.

It uses the **ANSI redefinition** technique to allow live color scheme switching and versatile themes (the same theme can be used with different color schemes).

At the moment, it works with `urxvt` (the required patch is `rxvt_unicode_xres256.diff`).

The main script is `genthm` which takes the hex value of the background color as first argument and the scheme name as optional second argument, it requires `Python` and the `python-colormath` library.
